I am a project manager with a proven ability to adapt rapidly to new technology. I completed a Full Stack Engineer boot camp, which focused on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, React.js, and Node.js. I am an innovator that works with organizations to embrace Agile and Scrum in order to increase communication, collaboration, and deliver value on time in short iterations. I worked with developers to improve sprint velocity by 15% across each sprint.  I have worked directly with up to five executive leaders to execute their vision to drive efficiency across the organization. Before transitioning into Tech and Project Management, I proved to exceed expectations in finding opportunity areas, removing waste, and automating processes that saved 10% of people’s time.  I have an understanding of key growth drivers and opportunities across all functional areas, and I am confident in my ability to plan, develop, implement a strategic vision, and deliver results. I am eager to apply these passions in obtaining a leadership position on a collaborative team focused on creating high-quality, innovative, and best in class solutions.
